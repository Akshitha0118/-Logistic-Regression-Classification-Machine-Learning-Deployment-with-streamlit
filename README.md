# -Logistic-Regression-Classification-Machine-Learning-Deployment-with-streamlit
I developed an end-to-end Machine Learning web app that visualizes actual data vs future predictions using Logistic Regression, all wrapped in an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

# 📊 Logistic Regression Classification Dashboard

An interactive **Streamlit-based Machine Learning dashboard** that demonstrates **Logistic Regression classification**, model evaluation, and visualization of **actual vs future data**.

This project is designed to showcase **end-to-end ML workflow** — from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization — all inside a clean web interface.

## 📊 Machine Learning Workflow

1. Load actual and future datasets  
2. Encode categorical variables  
3. Select features and target variable  
4. Split data into training and testing sets  
5. Apply feature scaling  
6. Train Logistic Regression model  
7. Evaluate model using accuracy & confusion matrix  
8. Visualize performance using ROC curve
